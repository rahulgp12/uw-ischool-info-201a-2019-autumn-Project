### Brief Introduction

Happiness scores and rankings are taken from Gallup World Poll, which ranks the state of global happiness between 2015 - 2017. These scores are based on answers to the questions asked on life evaluation polls. This dataset tries to represent the six factors: economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, generosity - and how they contribute to the overall happiness of the country.

We would like to see what factors matter most/least to a countryâ€™s overall happiness (magnitude-wise). Are there any trends based on the region the country belongs to, more specifically, is there a correlation between region and happiness score? Are certain regions more happy than other regions? How much do factors like economy and family play a role towards the happiness score? We will aim to address these questions and present any findings that stand out.
